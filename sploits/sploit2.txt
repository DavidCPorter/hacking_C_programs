This sploit is very similar to the first one. The only difference is that now
the target checks that the number of widget that must be copied is less than
the max number the buffer of struct widget can contain.

But the number of widget (count) is passed by commandline. The vulnerable of
the target is that tha comparison between count and MAX_WIDGETS considers
numbers like signed while the dimensione in memcpy consider the size as
unsigned.

Considering that the sign numbers are in 2complements we can pass a negative
number not so little, otherwise the unsigned one would be huge and memcpy
won't be executed. So i used -134217509 in this way the size used in memcpy
will be almost 7000 and will make the memcpy executed. 

The dimension of the string in orther to overflow the buffer is 7008 because
the MAX number of widgets is 204 and each one is 32bit so we need to put more
than 6528 bytes.

Then, figuring out the dimension on the stack to overwrite the instruction
pointer, we can insert there the address of the shellcode in the stack. This
is the same for sploit1.
