In this exploit we use the vulnerability caused by the format string in
snprintf. 

We use the %n in order to write whatever number we want in the buffer and so,
considering there is no check for overflow, we can also easily overlfow the
buffer and overwrite the return address. 

What we have done is figuring out the address of the shellcode in the stack
and then just insert 4 %n at the end of the format string preceeded by some %x
with dimension inside in order to write big numbers in the stack (the address
is big number). 
Every time a %n is found all the bytes vefore are summed up, so the last %n
will count all the bytes before considering also the ones before the %n. 
I have also used a %c as format when I needed to sum up just 3 bytes like
passing for example from fc to ff.
